This project is something between an Etch-A-Sketch and a sketchpad.

Two modes are available for grid colouring: 
  Colored,
  Black&White.

In Black&White mode, every hover adds 10% intensity to the grid.

Clear button clears the grid.
New grid button will prompt how many grids would you like to create. There are some restrictions for a possible unintentional input.
The new grid will be created in the same total space as before.
